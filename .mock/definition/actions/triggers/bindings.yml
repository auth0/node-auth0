        Retrieve the actions that are bound to a trigger. Once an action is
        created and deployed, it must be attached (i.e. bound) to a trigger so
        that it will be executed as part of a flow. The list of actions returned
        reflects the order in which they will be executed during the appropriate
        flow.
