      If set to 'ip', the app will enforce device binding by IP, meaning that
      consumption of session_token must be done from the same IP of the issuer.
      Likewise, if set to 'asn', device binding is enforced by ASN, meaning
      consumption of session_token must be done from the same ASN as the issuer.
      If set to 'null', device binding is not enforced.
