/**
 * When using an external IdP, this flag determines  whether 'name', 'given_name', 'family_name', 'nickname', and 'picture' attributes are updated. In addition, it also determines whether the user is created when user doesnt exist previously. Possible values are 'on_each_login' (default value, it configures the connection to automatically create the user if necessary and update the root attributes from the external IdP with each user login. When this setting is used, root attributes cannot be independently updated), 'on_first_login' (configures the connection to create the user and set the root attributes on first login only, allowing them to be independently updated thereafter), and 'never_on_login' (configures the connection not to create the user and not to set the root attributes from the external IdP, allowing them to be independently updated).
