/** Indicates whether device binding security should be enforced for the app. If set to 'ip', the app will enforce device binding by IP, meaning that consumption of Session Transfer Token must be done from the same IP of the issuer. Likewise, if set to 'asn', device binding is enforced by ASN, meaning consumption of Session Transfer Token must be done from the same ASN as the issuer. If set to 'null', device binding is not enforced. Usually configured in the web application. */
