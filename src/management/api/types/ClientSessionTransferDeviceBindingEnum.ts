 * Indicates whether device binding security should be enforced for the app. If set to 'ip', the app will enforce device binding by IP, meaning that consumption of session_token must be done from the same IP of the issuer. Likewise, if set to 'asn', device binding is enforced by ASN, meaning consumption of session_token must be done from the same ASN as the issuer. If set to 'null', device binding is not enforced.
